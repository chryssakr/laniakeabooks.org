        We charge £0. You only pay for the printing cost.
    </p>

    <p>
        Enriching the public domain should not cost anything. We believe in a gift economy and we
        act towards it. This is a service, as in: serving people. It’s a gift. We give as much as
        we feel comfortable—feel free to receive—only if you want to.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is of our future goals to take on the printing cost too.
