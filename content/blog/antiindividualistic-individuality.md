_Antiindividualistic Individuality: Anarchism’s Legacy_ by Gabriel Kuhn is the
second book that Laniakea Books publishes.

The text’s history is better outlined by the author in the
[Preface](/books/antiindividualistic-individuality/text/#preface-to-this-edition)
yet in an attempt to summarise: we’re republishing a text originally published in 2003 as a
pamphlet by [Alpine Anarchist Productions](https://alpineanarchist.org/).
The original title was _Antiindividualistic Individuality: A Concept_ and the
original author’s name was Teoman Gee (a pseudonym of Gabriel Kuhn).

[_Antiindividualistic Individuality: Anarchism’s Legacy_](/books/antiindividualistic-individuality/#table-of-contents)
is a small booklet that touches on a topic I find quite interesting yet at the
same time little discussed in the modern fora of political theory and
philosophy.

Similar to our first publication, one can
[read](/books/antiindividualistic-individuality/#read)
and
[download](/books/antiindividualistic-individuality/#download)
_Antiindividualistic Individuality: Anarchism’s Legacy_ for free.

One can [order](/books/antiindividualistic-individuality/#paperback) a paperback
copy and one can [pay](/books/antiindividualistic-individuality/#digital)
for the digital version.

One can explore the

along with all files and assets of which all versions of the book are composed
of.
