_[Letters from Prison](/books/letters-from-prison/)_ is the first book of
Laniakea Books!

_[Letters from Prison](/books/letters-from-prison/)_ was one of the initial
incentives to start Laniakea Books. The content of this book started quite
differently eight months ago, and even though it changed and evolved a lot,
the basic theme has remained the same: societal freedom.

The strategy with publishing this book (and our intention for all books we
publish) is to make it available for anyone to read in digital form but also
allow people to enjoy holding and reading from a physical hard copy.

To achieve this balance as a tiny and brand new publishing company, we follow an
approach that involves pre-ordering.

This book, along with everything Laniakea Books is doing, is open source and
public domain. Download this book, read it, change it, remix it, sell it,
burn it, eat it—anything you want—no questions asked, no permission required.

One can [read](/books/letters-from-prison/#read) and
[download](/books/letters-from-prison/#download)
_Letters from Prison_ for free.

One can [pre-order](/books/letters-from-prison/#paperback) a paperback copy
(shipping September 2023) and one can [pay](/books/letters-from-prison/#digital)
for the digital version (if they feel like it).

One can [read](https://github.com/laniakeabooks/book-letters-from-prison) the
source code and [see](https://github.com/laniakeabooks/book-letters-from-prison)
all files and assets of which _Letters from Prison_ is composed of.
