Greetings, folks!

This is Laniakea Books. One of the few public domain publishing houses — we
might even be the only one!

The goal of this company is to support independent authors and free knowledge
by publishing books in the [public domain](/philosophy/#public-domain).

Why public domain? Because copyright law doesn’t make any sense to our minds.

How are we making money? We do not; at least for now. We might find
money-making ways in the future. For the time being, we work for free.

Yes — it is pretty mad but hopefully our [Philosophy](/philosophy/) page is
adequately explanatory.

We welcome any feedback at team@laniakeabooks.org

Later <3
